## Feedbacks to work on 

1. beginning animation with the logos are a bit distracting, consider using a horizontal fly-in with opacity fade in
1. title font and content font sizes should be consistent
1. photo on the left instead of the right (imo)
1. add more clear separation between pages and contents
1. center the content you want users to see, in this case your about me
1. smaller navbar, and also center your elements as you don't have a lot for now
1. scaling reaction is a bit overdone, tone it down a bit... maybe
1. use dropshadows for better contrast and as an indication to the fact that this is an interactable element
1. a bit more border radius on the boxes (imo)
1. watch your text box width, you should be able to fit at least 3-5 words per line. Decrease your thumbnail size if it's necessary.
1. carve out a dedicated area for content stats (like counts, dates, etc...)
1. add your copyright at the bottom
1. a contact me form would do wonders
1. some sort of page navigation, but it's not strictly necessary. I don't have one, but it might be nice for you to have one
1. actually explain in the "What do I do"... what do you do?
1. avoid using gradients on your navbar, it's really hard to get right for bigger elements. Instead, use a high opacity (but not opaque) background color, and add a backdrop filter with blur(13px) or so on it. It will look fantastic.
1. stretch your contents our a bit more to fill the void on the sides
1. give the page a proper conclusion rather than just ending it there. This goes back to the contact form and stuff.
1. use more font varieties. I know it's not Poppins, but try giving your title and body different fonts. It makes them stand out more.
1. good mobile layout, just watch the centering and stuff a bit more
1. mobile link for blog on the nav just disappears?
1. watch horizontal overflow on your mobile view. This will lead to an awful UI experience
1. disable hover on mobile. It will cause problems when people actually use it on their phone (unless it's intentional)
1. good mobile card layouts
1. get a dedicated social section for mobile, so that it's easier to view and click on 
1. better twitter cards
1. Link hover without `inline-block` [reference](https://github.com/genicsblog/theme-files/pull/26)
